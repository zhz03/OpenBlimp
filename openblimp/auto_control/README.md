# Autonomous control README

This directory contains all the code that relates to manual control. So far, we have one autonomous control version with different sensing algorithms:

- esp32 feather board + esp32 cam 
- esp32 feather board + openmv
- esp32 feather board + nicla vision 

For the capture mechanism, we also have three different methods:

- Passive cage
- Active cage
- Active net
