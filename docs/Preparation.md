# Hardware Preparation

## 1 Balloon Envelop 

### For off-the-shelf blimp

### For DIY 

## 2 Propulsion system

For propulsion system, we will try motor+propellers as propulsion solution. You need to prepare the following items:

- Motors (Both DC or brushless motors would work)
  - For brushless motors, you also need ESC( Electric Speed Controller )
- Propellers

Here are some examples (different DC motors and propellers combinations):

As listed above, the propellers should be compatible with your motor.
