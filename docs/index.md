# Welcome to OpenBlimp website!

Welcome to OpenBlimp's documentation. **OpenBlimp** is a open source packages to manufacture, build and control your custom blimp from scratch. 

For normal users, it's easy to build your manual control system by following the step by step process. And for developer users, OpenBlimp also allows users to develop their own autonomous algorithms on the blimp.

OpenBlimp is a work in progress. Many features on the roadmap are being continuously developed. We welcome your contribution and please visit our Github repo for latest release.
