# User interface

## Introduction

We provided several user interface in OpenBlimp to satisfy different needs. Our user interface includes:

- **Blynk App**

  Our user interface is using Blynk app for any users who have cellphone to download.

  *Blynk* platform powers low-batch manufacturers of smart home products, complex HVAC systems, agricultural equipment, and everyone in between.

- **Game Controller**

  Game controller provides lots of physical joystick and buttons which is good for controlling without seeing. The physical feedback from joystick will help in better control. **Therefore, this method is most recommended.**

- **Keyboard**

  For those who doesn't want to use Game controller and Blynk App, keyboard is also another available option that we provide.

You can also customize your own interface as long as you have the following functionality:

- **Control panel**: your control panel should include two joystick and one slider to give you the ability to control motion primitives(horizontal, vertical and rotation) and all motor propellers speed.
- **Configuration commands**: this will be the *terminal* widgets in the Blynk. This is for sending to correct configuration commands to configure the hardware mapping.

The corresponding mapping between game controller and function of the airship is in the following table:

| Game controller                          | Airship functions                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Left stick ($\uparrow,\downarrow,\leftarrow,\rightarrow$) | forward, backward,turn left, turn right  |
| Right stick ($\uparrow,\downarrow,\leftarrow,\rightarrow$) | Go up, go down, head up, tail up         |
| left bumper (LB)                         | 50% speed                                |
| Right bumper (RB)                        | 100% full speed                          |
| Y                                        | To set searching camera back to forward position |
| X,Y                                      | To turn the searching camera to the left or right |
|                                          |                                          |
