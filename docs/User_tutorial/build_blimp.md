# Build Your Blimp

To build your blimp, you can not only use the off-the-shelf blimp as shown in the [Quick Start]() on the market. You can also have the following options: 

- 36 inch balloon: [Sphere shape](https://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Jumbo-Sports-Party-Balloons/dp/B07G7FDLBG) or [Heart shape](https://www.amazon.com/Balloons-Romantic-Wedding-Decorations-Champagne/dp/B07MCNTC91). These balloon gives you the minimum capacity but the smallest size to hold everything we provided. However, some modification is required to make for it to hold all the payloads.
- [DIY Balloon](): This will give you the most freedom of making customized shape of your blimp.

### Materials preparation

Before you DIY your own blimp, please prepare the following materials. 

- Envelope material: [Mylar sheet](http://film.fluffyscarsdale.com/home.html). If you want to know the reason why we pick Mylar as our first choice, please check [Different Materials]().
- Tools: 
  - [Masking/Painter's tape](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y38RKKY): You can buy these at [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/), [Homedepo](https://www.homedepot.com/?mtc=SEM-BF-CDP-GGL-Multi-Multi-NA-Multi-NA-ETA-NA-NA-NA-NA-BT1-NA-NA-NA-THD&cm_mmc=SEM-BF-CDP-GGL-Multi-Multi-NA-Multi-NA-ETA-NA-NA-NA-NA-BT1-NA-NA-NA-THD-71700000002449093-58700000047535271-43700003817114565&ds_rl=5041&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2_OWBhDqARIsAAUNTTHLn-O567gAP0e3lxsaA8VB52r3M4EZPugEVE_6Pjh4bXTd3QR3a38aAvqqEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Target](https://www.target.com/c/baby/-/N-5xtly?clkid=aeb41fc7Ne81511ec9ad3e7b09f34e289&lnm=1337494&afid=Parole%20Paris&ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002) or any other store. You may also need some other tape like [scotch tape](https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-Shipping-Packaging-Dispenser-142-6/dp/B000J07BRQ), [Duct tape](https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-Basic-Duct-Rolls-1055-3PK/dp/B01CM2Z4SG)
  - scissors: You need to cut the mylar sheet with it, please do not use knife, it will be easier and safer to cut with scissors.
  - [Mylar sealer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BLU4SA): This will be the key tool to seal your mylar sheet.
  - [soldering iron](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756VKPTB): This will cut out the sealed mylar after you seal it.
  - [parchment paper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QB239H): This is for isolate your mylar sealer from attaching the mylar directly. You can get this in any super market like Ralphs, Whole Foods and so on.
- Infrastructure: 
  - Tables: It should be bigger than your DIY balloon size. If one table is not big enough, you can attach two or more tables together.
  - Plywood: It really depends on how big you want to make your blimp. If you want to make bigger balloon, you can use [bigger size plywood](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNQM21). It's not necessary to just my link. 

### Manufacture process

There are two different ways we've explored to manufacture a balloon that has high quality and less gas leakage problems to worry about in the future:

- Method 1: Double-sided mylar balloon
- Method 2: Starfruit mylar balloon

Method 1 is most recommended and easier and more friendly to a newbie. 

For method 1, Please check [Blimp Manufacturing:Mylar Blimp Envelope]().
