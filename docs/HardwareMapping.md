# Hardware Mapping

For the blimp system, one important aspect to notice is the mapping between your control and hardware. We design a user interface for normal user to easily control blimps they design. However, to control blimp exactly as expected, users need to build up the correct mapping between control and propulsion system of blimps.

To be more specific, what's the right wiring and control mapping as shown below:

For example, you want to build a blimp that has 4 motors+propellers output, how do you match your hardware with your joystick controller on your cellphone.
